<h1>CI Lot</h1>


<h3>1.1 Background</h3>

Channel Islands Campus has had an ever increasing number of students enrolling every year, however the parking lots have not necessarily increased along with these students.  Finding parking on campus is a nightmare/time consuming process. Students can spend a lot of unnecessary time traversing from lot to lot in search for a place to park. This app would be designed to inform students which lots are currently full and where students can currently in a similar style that Waze uses user-input for traffic. CI-Lot will use those inputs from the users to visually display the CSUCI map and display the current traffic of each lot.


<h3>1.2 Business Opportunity</h3>

There is currently no efficient product to solve this issue. Although the college has attempted to improve parking by expanding the parking lots, the amount of students needing to park expands at a much faster rate than the amount of new parking spaces created. This application aims to give students an extra helping hand to find parking on campus. As of today, there are no on-campus parking aids that takes care of this problem. The app will give the students a visual aid identifying which lots are currently available, which will save them time to find parking closest to their classrooms.




<h3>1.3 Vision Statement</h3>

For CSUCI students to relieve the stress of finding parking, CI Lot will help with finding  a parking spot in the most efficient way, and decrease the amount of traffic in a parking lot searching for a spot. It will give you a visual aid for each parking lot and it will assist you in determining the best lot to look for a parking spot.
Long term it will reduce congestion, gas consumption and time spent searching for parking.


<h3>Major Features:</h3>

The major user capability would be to give CSUCI students the ability to mark which parking lots currently have space through user inputs and displaying them as a graph. Each time a user parks, they would answer a poll and the results of that poll will be fed into a database which would then calculate available parking. There are currently no competing products currently available at CSUCI campus.
